# Tasks

The working board. [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) is the long-term plan; this file tracks what is happening **now**.
Updated at the start and end of every step.

## Now

### Step 19c: Containers on ARM (on `feature/go-live`)
- [x] Checked that everything runs on Oracle's free ARM server: all six pinned images include arm64, every Python package has an ARM file (pinned hashes cover all published files), the dashboard's build tool has its ARM Linux binary in the lockfile
- [x] CI runs the Containers job on ARM too ("Containers (ARM)"), and both copies check every container runs on that machine's kind of processor (ADR-56)
- [ ] All checks pass on GitHub, including "Containers (ARM)"
- [ ] Merged, and "Containers (ARM)" added to `Protect main` as the 12th required check (Mohit)

## Waiting

### Step 19d: Going live (paused: the Oracle Cloud sign-up needs a card that works)
Decided: Oracle Cloud's free ARM server in India South (Hyderabad), staying on the free tier (ADR-56), the DuckDNS name `casewright`.
- [ ] Oracle Cloud account (Mohit; the sign-up stopped at the card check)
- [ ] The free ARM server (Ubuntu, Ampere A1), with an SSH key made on the laptop
- [ ] Ports 80 and 443 open (Oracle's network rules and the server's own firewall)
- [ ] The DuckDNS name `casewright` points at the server (Mohit)
- [ ] Docker installed; the system started with `deploy/make-secrets.sh` and `docker compose up`
- [ ] Checked from outside: HTTPS, the demo button, a demo run, the audit chain
- [ ] `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`: how it was set up and how to look after it; the live link in the README

## Later

Design and UI/UX polish (next, while 19d waits), then step 20: the final handbook.

## Done

- **2026-11-13:** Step 19b (public demo mode) merged: PR #23, with the dashboard screenshot. Its first checks were stuck for a day by a GitHub Actions outage; an empty commit started fresh ones, which all passed (15 smoke checks).
- **2026-11-11:** Step 19a (containers) merged. "Containers" is the 11th required check on `main`.
- **2026-11-10:** Step 18b (evaluation) merged: PR #21.
- **2026-11-09:** Step 18a (CI security gate) merged: PR #20. All 10 checks are required on `main`.
- **2026-11-08:** Step 17b (red-team probe) merged: PR #19.
- **2026-11-06:** Step 17a (demo scenarios) merged: PR #18. The README now covers the safety approach, evidence and limitations.
- **2026-11-05:** Step 16b (live stream) merged: PR #17.
- **2026-11-03:** Step 16a (dashboard) merged: PR #16. "Dashboard tests" is now a required check on `main`.
- **2026-11-02:** Step 15 (human approval) merged: PR #15.
- **2026-10-31:** Step 14 (audit log) merged: PR #14.
- **2026-10-30:** Step 13 (dual explanation) merged: PR #13.
- **2026-10-29:** Step 12 (LLM reasoning agent, local model) merged: PR #12.
- **2026-10-27:** Step 11 (risk score, verdict, rule engine) merged: PR #11.
- **2026-10-25:** Step 10b (related incidents) merged: PR #10.
- **2026-10-24:** Step 10 (baseline check, pattern match, correlation) merged: PR #9.
- **2026-10-23:** Step 9 (reputation lookup, evidence chain) merged: PR #8.
- **2026-10-22:** Fixed a flaky test: "not echoed" checks were sometimes fooled by the random trace ID (a short value like `ab` appears in one in about 17 trace IDs). Checks now blank the trace ID first (`NoEcho`).
- **2026-10-22:** Step 8 (agent service, secure connection) merged: PR #6. "Agent tests" is now a required check on `main`.
- **2026-10-21:** Step 7 (incident ingestion, encrypted baselines) merged: PR #5.
- **2026-10-19:** Step 6 (rate limiting) merged: PR #4.
- **2026-10-18:** Step 5b (local HTTPS) merged: PR #3.
- **2026-10-16:** Step 5a (CI on GitHub Actions, protected `main`) merged: PR #2.
